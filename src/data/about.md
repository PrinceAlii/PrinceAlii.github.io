## Hi!

I’m Ali Bonagdaran, a Graduate at the Australian Bureau of Statistics in Sydney, Australia. I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology at the University of Technology Sydney in Nov 2025 and focus on cloud, automation, and infrastructure engineering.

I enjoy practical problem solving, including:
- Scripting deployments
- Improving developer workflows
- Making services easier to run and support

I’ve also supported customers in banking and government service environments, so I care about reliability and the real people on the other end of the system.
