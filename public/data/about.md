## Hi!

I’m Ali Bonagdaran, an IT student at the University of Technology Sydney and a DevOps Cadet with the Australian Bureau of Statistics in Sydney, Australia. I’m building capability across cloud, automation and infrastructure engineering while completing my Bachelor of Information Technology (expected Nov 2025).

I enjoy practical problem solving: scripting deployments, improving developer workflows, and making services easier to run and support. I’ve also supported customers in banking and government service environments, so I care about reliability and the real people on the other end of the system.
