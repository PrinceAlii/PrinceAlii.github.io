<p>
  RateMyUni is a full-stack platform that aggregates and standardizes university subject feedback across Australia.
  It combines handbook scraping, verified student reviews, and search tools to help students make better unit decisions.
</p>

<h2>What I Built</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Configurable scraping workflows for different handbook architectures (CourseLoop, search-driven, and legacy HTML).</li>
  <li>A modern React frontend with fast unit lookup and filtering.</li>
  <li>Verified review flows with email authentication and moderation safeguards.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous ingestion pipelines using Redis job queues for bulk updates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>Web:</code> React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query</li>
  <li><code>API:</code> Node.js, Fastify, BullMQ</li>
  <li><code>Data:</code> PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, Redis</li>
  <li><code>Infra:</code> Terraform, AWS (EC2, RDS, ECR), Cloudflare proxy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Created a central, searchable source of course-level review data.</li>
  <li>Improved data reliability through normalized scraping and moderation tooling.</li>
  <li>Established a production-ready deployment pipeline with infrastructure as code.</li>
</ul>
